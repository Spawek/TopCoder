/**
 * PROBLEM STATEMENT: 
The hotel industry is difficult to thrive in, especially when competing at a resort city like Las Vegas. Marketing is essential and often gets a large part of total revenues. You have a list of cities you can market at, and a good estimate of how many customers you will get for a certain amount of money spent at each city.  You are given int[]s customers and cost. cost[i] is the amount of money required to get customers[i] customers from the i-th city. You are only allowed to spend integer multiples of the cost for any city. For example, if it costs 9 to get 3 customers from a certain city, you can spend 9 to get 3 customer, 18 to get 6 customers, 27 to get 9 customers, but not 3 to get 1 customer, or 12 to get 4 customers. Each city has an unlimited number of potential customers. Return the minimum amount of money required to get at least minCustomers customers.

 * LIMITS:
 * time limit: 2.000s
 * memory limit: 64MB

/**
 * CONSTRAINTS: 
 * Constraints-minCustomers will be between 1 and 1000, inclusive.-customers will contain between 1 and 20 elements, inclusive.-cost will have the same number of elements as customers.-Each element of cost and customers will be between 1 and 100, inclusive.
